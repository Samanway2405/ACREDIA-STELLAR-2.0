## 1. Vision & positioning (the one-pager)

**Vision.** A world where an academic achievement is instantly and freely verifiable by anyone, anywhere — where a degree can never be faked, lost, or held hostage by a portal that shuts down.

**Positioning statement.**
For **educational institutions** that need to issue credentials their graduates can trust and prove, **Acredia** is a **verifiable-credential platform** that anchors every credential to the Stellar blockchain and lets employers verify authenticity in seconds — unlike **paper/PDF documents** (easy to forge) and **centralized verification portals** (slow, siloed, and a single point of failure), Acredia makes credentials **tamper-proof, student-owned, and free to verify**.

### Problem
- **Fraud is easy and common.** Paper and PDF diplomas/transcripts can be edited or fabricated with off-the-shelf tools.
- **Verification is slow and manual.** Employers and institutions spend days emailing/calling registrars to confirm a single credential.
- **Records are fragile.** When a portal is decommissioned or a student loses access, proof of achievement can disappear.
- **Trust is centralized.** A single database is a single point of failure and a single point of control.

### Solution
Acredia gives each credential a **cryptographic fingerprint anchored on-chain** and stores the supporting document on decentralized storage (IPFS). Verification recomputes and matches that fingerprint — proving authenticity **without a phone call and without exposing private data**.

- **Institutions** issue credentials in minutes and can revoke them if needed, with a full audit trail.
- **Students** hold their credentials for life in a wallet-linked dashboard and share a link or QR code.
- **Anyone** verifies authenticity instantly and for free — no account required.

### Why Stellar
- **Sub-cent fees** make issuing at scale (thousands of credentials per term) economically viable.
- **3–5 second settlement** gives near-instant issuance and verification.
- **Energy-efficient, battle-tested, decentralized** infrastructure with native Rust smart contracts (Soroban) — no single point of failure, and no proof-of-work energy cost.
- **Global reach** aligned with a network built for financial inclusion — fitting for credentials that must be recognized across borders.

### Why now
- **Digital credentialing is going mainstream** (micro-credentials, bootcamps, professional certs) and demand for portable, verifiable proof is rising.
- **Open standards have matured** (W3C Verifiable Credentials, Open Badges 3.0), making interoperability realistic rather than aspirational.
- **Credential fraud is a growing, well-documented problem**, and remote hiring has multiplied the number of verifications employers must perform.
- **On-chain fees are now low enough** (sub-cent on Stellar) that anchoring every credential is affordable at institutional scale.

## 2. Market & ideal customer profile (ICP)

**Category:** Verifiable credentials / academic-credential infrastructure.

**Primary ICP (beachhead).** Small-to-mid-size, innovation-friendly **issuers of high-verification-demand credentials**:
- Coding bootcamps, professional-training providers, and certification bodies.
- Individual departments or continuing-education units within universities.

Why start here: shorter sales cycles than large universities, credentials that are verified frequently (so the value is immediate), and stakeholders comfortable adopting new technology.

**Expansion ICP.** Full universities/colleges and national skilling programs (longer cycles, higher volume, procurement-driven).

**Non-goals (for now).** Consumer-only "self-attested" badges with no issuing authority; mainnet token speculation; identity/KYC as a standalone product.

## 3. Personas & jobs-to-be-done (JTBD)

| Persona | Who they are | Job-to-be-done (JTBD) |
|---|---|---|
| **Institution admin / decision-maker** | Registrar office lead, program director, IT/innovation lead | "When my institution issues credentials, I want them to be impossible to forge and effortless to verify, so we protect our reputation and cut verification workload." |
| **Registrar / issuing staff** | The person who actually issues credentials each term | "When I issue credentials, I want a fast, reliable, bulk-friendly workflow with an audit trail, so I can process many students without errors." |
| **Student / graduate** | Recent or past graduate, job seeker | "When I apply for jobs or further study, I want to prove my achievements instantly and keep them for life, so I never depend on a slow portal or lose my records." |
| **Employer / verifier** | Recruiter, HR, ATS platform, admissions office | "When I receive a credential, I want to confirm it's genuine in seconds and for free, so I can hire/admit confidently without chasing registrars." |
| **Platform admin / operator** | Acredia operator governing trust | "When institutions apply to issue, I want to vet and authorize only legitimate issuers, so credentials on Acredia stay trustworthy." |

## 4. Value proposition per persona

- **Institution admin** — *Protect your brand, cut costs.* Fraud-proof credentials and near-zero verification overhead; a modern, differentiating signal to prospective students.
- **Registrar / issuing staff** — *Issue in minutes, not hours.* Guided issuance (and, on the roadmap, bulk CSV import), one-click revocation, and a clear record of every action.
- **Student / graduate** — *Own it for life.* One dashboard for every credential, shareable by link/QR, portable across borders and independent of any single institution's portal.
- **Employer / verifier** — *Verify instantly, free.* Confirm authenticity (and, on the roadmap, integrity and revocation status) in seconds from a QR code or link — no login, no back-and-forth.
- **Platform admin** — *Govern trust.* Authorize only vetted issuers on-chain, with an auditable approval trail.

## 5. Differentiators (top 3 vs. incumbents)

**vs. Paper / PDF documents**
1. **Tamper-proof, not editable.** Authenticity is proven cryptographically against an on-chain anchor — not by a signature or watermark that can be copied.
2. **Instant, free verification.** No registrar call; anyone with the link/QR verifies in seconds.
3. **Permanent & portable.** The credential outlives any single file, folder, or email account.

**vs. Centralized verification portals (national clearinghouses, university portals)**
1. **No single point of failure or control.** The proof lives on a decentralized ledger; verification doesn't depend on one company's uptime or business survival.
2. **Student-owned, not gatekept.** Students hold and share their own credentials instead of paying/waiting for a portal to release them.
3. **Open and interoperable (roadmap).** Aligning with W3C VC / Open Badges 3.0 means credentials work across wallets and HR systems, not just inside one walled garden.

**vs. Other blockchain-credentialing platforms**
1. **Cost & speed built for scale.** Stellar's sub-cent fees and 3–5s settlement make anchoring *every* credential affordable — many chains make per-credential issuance too expensive.
2. **Privacy-first by design (roadmap).** Only a hash goes on-chain; documents are encrypted, so a public ledger never exposes student PII.
3. **Governed issuer trust.** A vetting/authorization workflow (KYB) ensures only legitimate institutions can issue — the credential's value comes from *who* issued it, not just that it's on a chain.

## 6. Business model & pricing

**Principle:** *Issuers pay; verification is always free.* Free, unlimited public verification maximizes network value and adoption; institutions capture that value and pay for issuance and tooling.

### Revenue streams
1. **Per-credential issuance fee** — a small fee per issued credential (covers on-chain + IPFS costs plus margin). Naturally usage-based and aligned with institution value.
2. **Institution subscription tiers** — recurring plans bundling issuance volume, seats, branding, analytics, and support.
3. **Verification API / partner access (roadmap)** — paid, higher-limit API keys and embeddable widgets for ATS/HR platforms that verify at scale (public one-off verification stays free).
4. **Value-added services (later)** — custom credential templates/branding, bulk import tooling, SSO, and premium support/SLAs.

### Illustrative pricing tiers (directional, not final)
| Tier | Audience | Includes | Pricing shape |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Free / Pilot** | Evaluators, small programs | Low monthly issuance cap, core dashboard, public verification | $0 |
| **Growth** | Bootcamps, departments | Higher issuance volume, bulk import, branding, basic analytics | Monthly subscription + per-credential over cap |
| **Institution** | Universities, cert bodies | High volume, SSO, advanced analytics, verification API, SLA | Annual contract + volume-based |

**Always free:** public verification for employers and individuals (no account, no fee).

**Unit-economics note:** on Stellar testnet the on-chain cost is effectively zero; on mainnet the marginal cost per credential is sub-cent plus IPFS pinning — so the per-credential fee is almost entirely margin, and free verification costs only read/RPC and bandwidth.

## 7. Go-to-market (motion, brief)

1. **Land** design-partner issuers (bootcamps / departments) with a free pilot; issue a real cohort's credentials.
2. **Prove value** through frequent employer verifications (the credential gets used, not shelved).
3. **Expand** within the institution (more programs/departments) and convert to paid tiers.
4. **Distribute** via verifiers: embeddable "Verify with Acredia" widget + API pulls employers/ATS into the ecosystem, which pulls in more issuers (two-sided network effect).
5. **Standards & trust** (issuer registry, VC/OBv3 export) make Acredia credentials recognized beyond the platform.

## 8. Success metrics (KPIs)

**North-star metric:** **verified credentials in use** — credentials that have been issued *and* verified at least once (proof the network creates real value, not just storage).

**Acquisition & supply (issuers)**
- Institutions **applied → verified (KYB) → actively issuing**.
- Time-to-first-credential for a new issuer.

**Core usage**
- **Credentials issued / month** (and cumulative).
- **Verifications / month** (and verifications per issued credential — the "usage" ratio).
- Active issuing institutions (issued ≥1 credential in the period).

**Retention & expansion**
- Issuer retention (month-over-month active issuers).
- Net revenue retention across tiers; expansion from Free → paid.
- Verification-API partners onboarded.

**Trust & reliability**
- Verification success rate and p95 verification latency.
- Credential availability (IPFS pin health); incidents.

**Business**
- MRR/ARR by tier; per-credential revenue; gross margin per credential.
- CAC and payback for issuer accounts.

*Early-stage targets are set per quarter and tracked in the product dashboard once the analytics/indexer work (see backlog) lands. Numbers here describe the metric definitions, not current results — Acredia currently runs on testnet.*
